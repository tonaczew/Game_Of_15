The 15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position.

The challange of this game is to sort the shuffled tiles into their correct numerical order. You can move the tiles by dragging them one at a time, into the empty space, which allows you to reposition the other tiles around it.
